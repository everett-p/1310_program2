# CSC 1310 Program 2: Grocery Store Inventory
This program will follow a menu based execution to direct the user to managing the inventory of a grocery store, the program will allow the user to control and manage various attributes about the stocked items in the store, between quantity, price, caloric density, and several others

## Program Flow
The program will be menu based, interacted through the CLI. The program will continue to loop until the user manually and intentionally ends the program. In each loop the user will be prompted with a set of options tied to indicated selector inputs to allow the user to interact with their Grocery Store.
